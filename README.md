# 🛒 Cohorts Analysis

## :dart: Objective
Analyze customer behavior over time to calculate customer's retention rate and deliver information to the marketing area about the average revenue a user will generate over time (LTV) and the return on marketing investment (ROMI) for each source channel.

## 🛠️ Tools used
- Numpy
- Scypy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

 ## 🔍 Observations
  - Users are been consistently lost every month in almost every cohort. A funnel analysis would help us understand in which stage the loss is greater, potentially pointing to the actual reason of customer's leave.
  - Every cohort shows an increasing LTV, but at very different rates. Some groups even seem tobe affected by stationality and should be looked into.
  - After calculating the customer acquisition cost for every channel, it is clear that a strong investment was made for a specific source and has not worked as expected. This channel should be adjusted in budget and perhaps switch those resources to the channel that shows better revenue.
